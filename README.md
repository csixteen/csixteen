### Oh hi ðŸ‘‹

What is currently keeping me busy:
- [99Problems](https://github.com/csixteen/99Problems) => my functional programming playground.
- [LeetCode](https://github.com/csixteen/LeetCode) => Mostly Rust, Python and Scala.
- [Clerk](https://github.com/csixteen/clerk) => simple productivity tool for the command-line implemented in Go.

You can also find me on IRC @ Freenode (C-16). :speech_balloon:
