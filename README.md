### Oh hi ðŸ‘‹

What is currently keeping me busy:
- [LeetCode](https://github.com/csixteen/LeetCode) => ()
- [cl-bff](https://github.com/csixteen/cl-bff) => [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in Common Lisp. It's pretty much done.
- [DmgEmul](https://github.com/csixteen/DmgEmul) => a classic GameBoy emulator. This is my "Learn Rust the hard way".

You can also find me on IRC @ Freenode (C-16). :speech_balloon:
