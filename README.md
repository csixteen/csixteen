### Oh hi ðŸ‘‹

What is currently keeping me busy:
- [99Problems](https://github.com/csixteen/99Problems) => my functional programming playground.
- [DmgEmul](https://github.com/csixteen/DmgEmul) => a classic GameBoy emulator. This is my "Learn Rust the hard way".
- [LeetCode](https://github.com/csixteen/LeetCode) => a bit less these days.

You can also find me on IRC @ Freenode (C-16). :speech_balloon:
